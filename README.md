# About Knowledge Stitcher
Developed by Casey Viens & George Saban Jr. (starting 7/12/2022), Knowledge Stitcher is a nascent inference engine that connects related ideas and content among videos, documents, or images.  A specific business case application is for K-12 educational school systems to create a localized repository of information that faculty can upload their lecture content or other learning materials online, and students can easily access in a meaningful way via complex queries.  This project was originally created for NEIT quarter 12 SE425.80 Senior Project capstone course, and to serve as a source control repository for Team Index Innovators' Knowledge Stitcher application.

# Deployment Guide
Detailed instructions on how to deploy the application can be found in the [project's wiki](https://se414-wiki.herokuapp.com/ "Named link title") under the "Week 20" tab, labeled "Technical Documentation".
